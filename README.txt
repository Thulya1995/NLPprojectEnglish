==Open and and run the project==

1.This project is develop in pycharm IDE. So that you have to use pycharm for opening this projec.
2.there are four separate packages named base_line, stop_words, word_length_filtering and infrequnecy+word_filtering
3.Each packege contains the ".py" wich contains the corresponding funtionality
4.So that if you want to run specific experiment you have to configure the file path of the ".ph" to the python compiler in pycharm
	i. if you want to run the base_line experiment then set the path to NlpClassifierModel.py
	ii. if you want to run the stop_word experiment then set the path to StopWordFilter.py
	iii. if you want to run the word_length experiment then set the path to WordLengthFiltering.py
	iv. if you want to run the fisrt graph then set the path to Infrequent_word_filter.py
	v. if you want to run the second graph then set the path to most_frequnt_word_filter.py

==Change the data set==

In order to change the data set of the project. You have to copy the new
data set csv file into the above mentioned four packages.

==Out put files==

For the experiment 1, 2, 3 each package contains four text files that contains the
expected outputs.

==Out put==

The pragram finally show the accuracy of the model in expiermented cases.
